It showcases the power of component-based design and React's state management in building modern user interfaces.

## 🧠 Big Picture

This app represents a scalable approach to building structured productivity tools using front-end technologies. It follows these key design principles:

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable UI components built with React.
- **State Management with Hooks**: Real-time UI updates using `useState`.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Cleanly separated logic (JavaScript), structure (HTML/JSX), and styling (CSS).
- **Scalable List Nesting**: Add multiple headings, and under each heading, manage multiple lists dynamically.

The application can serve as a building block for larger productivity tools like:
- Project Planners
- Bullet Journals
- Study Schedulers
- Team Task Boards
